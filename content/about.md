![KFA members fishing](/images/front_page/montage.jpg)

*The Kayak Fishing Association of New York* (**KFA**) is a 503\(c\) non-profit membership organization founded in 2007 with the following core principles:

- Fostering and promoting the sport of kayak fishing
- Ensuring safety with proper gear and knowledge of conditions
- Working for conservation of our environment and marine life

We are a group of kayak fishers from the NY metro area. Our membership is very diverse with ability levels from experts to beginners of all ages sharing their knowledge freely in a non competitive friendly organization.

The KFA-NY holds meetings both indoors in the winter, and outdoors during the warmer months. Six are held indoors during the winter months. Our winter indoor meetings are free and open to the public. At these meetings we share our knowledge to become better kayak fishers, have guest presenters, and offer hands-on activities. Our summer meetings are for members only. At our summer meetings a brief meeting is held to discuss club activities. After this meeting, members may choose to fish surrounding waters.

We also have a forum for all kayak fishers, from beginner to advanced to exchange ideas, techniques and skills of the sport. We are committed to passing on these skills and traditions of the sport to the next generation of kayak fishers. This forum is open to the public once you register as a user. There is also a memberâ€™s only area which contains specific information related to kayak fishing as well as club member discounts.
