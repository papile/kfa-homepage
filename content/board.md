#### Here are some of the past and present members who have helped shape the club and help keep it so successful.


### George White (georgeD)- President
![georged](/images/bod/georged.jpg)

I have resided in Sayville since the age of 13, living that close to the Great South Bay offered plenty of opportunities for fishing, clamming, and enjoying other water sports. I was fortunate to have a dad that loved fishing and was willing to spend time teaching fishing, proper boat handling and conservation. I am now retired after spending 40 years in law enforcement the last 33 years with the Suffolk County Police Department. When off from the police Dept. I clammed on the GSB and later ran a lobster boat out of Mattituck. These giving me a lot of knowledge of those waters. Around 2004 I read an article in a fishing magazine about guys in Jersey fishing out of kayaks, this intrigued me. So looking for a new way to gain access I thought this would be something to get involved in. I took my first trip of many to see Jon Shein at KFS, and purchased my first fishing kayak a Tarpon 120. I would buy my second from him a year later, my first Hobie, a Revolution. Around 2006 kayak fishing post were becoming more active on the Stripers-On-Line forum. Following up on these post, a group consisting of our charter members (acknowledged in a forum thread) and the first Board consisting of Stan Knipe, Ed Sinn, Bob Skoy, Anthony Weiss, Carl Schneider and myself worked to create a local kayak club. The work of the above charter members and the first board formed the KFA-NY. Although I occasionally fish from a boat or surf nothing compares to the thrill of fishing from a kayak. Whether fishing for Sails or porgies kayak fishing is the way to go!

### Rick Grabowski (Rick67)- Director

46 years on the water. From Jamaica Bay to the Canyon, Islamorada, to Daytona, and all the lakes in between. Whether boat, canoe, kayak, or wading. Cane pole, bait caster, spinning, fly rod, or conventional. Hasn't been a lapse of any duration of time that I haven't been with rod in hand. Most of my growing up was in Fla. Have to believe my Dad was on a mission to introduce me to all he knew about fishing knowing he wasn't going to be around to watch me grow up. He left when I was fifteen for wherever we all end up eventually but instilled a passion that still reins today. The kayak originally was a way for me to make my time on the water more a challenge. However it turned into a extreme advantage and find myself pitying most that look at it as less.* This Club introduced me to camaraderie within the fishing community that I hadn't thought possible. I hope to be part of it for many years to come. 

### Mike Papile (papile) - Secretary

I joined the KFA in 2015, and since then have become an avid kayak fisherman getting on the water several times a week. I work as a software developer and I am interested in just about everything. After learning so much from the club and actively participating, helping with the operations and governance was a way that I felt I could give back to such a great group of people. When I'm not kayak fishing I am skiing, brewing beer, fixing stuff or learning random information of varying degrees of usefulness. I am very interested in conservation and marine biology as well, and appreciate being in a group that considers conservation part of their charter.

### Darren Mikula (Dragonfish) - Vice-President

Look how happy I am!

### Rick Gambino (aka Flukebelly)- Treasurer 
![rick](/images/bod/rick.jpg)

I am 61 years old with 2 children, Chris is a Computer Solutions Engineer for Google in Boston and Laura is a Data Scientist. I started kayak fishing after my son started kayaking with the Boy Scouts about 14 years ago. I joined the KFA-NY in 2009 and have not fished from my boat since. 8 years ago my wife bought me my Hobie as an anniversary gift (is she good or what).I kayak year round whenever there is open water and tend to fish the Mount Sinai Harbor area before work most mornings and the Moriches area on weekends. Since I've joined the club though I've been please to also fish with members from LNB to Shinnecock. Now if I can just catch something other than searobins. Tight lines all.

### Mike McLoughlin - (Behemoth) - Director
![mike](/images/bod/mikem.jpg)

I am a Chief Engineer and run a building on Madison Ave in the city where I am just starting my 34th year of working there. I was always an avid surf fisherman and made quite a few friends through the Nor'east website and their surf related events. But in 2008 I finally decided to get into the kayak fishing realm and bought my Ocean Kayak and have been extremely happy ever since. One of the deciding factors was talking to the likes of Carl and Dennis at some of the Paddle Fest events or the Nor'east Seminars and after seeing their Rigged up Kayaks and pictures of fish they caught, I knew I wanted to be a part of this amazing club. Now after 10 years of being a member I am honored to be a part of the more intricate workings of the club and helping to make it better every year. 

### John Hagan (KABETH) - Director
![kabeth](/images/bod/kabeth.jpg)

I take the approach that a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work. I've been kayak fishing for 12 years now and have been a member of KFA since almost it's start. I've see it grow over the years and have always been impressed with how free flowing advice and fishing tips come from members. My fishing has gone from mostly the North Shore to all over the island. That can be attributed to this club and it's members for contributing their knowledge of other areas to fish around the island. Remember three fourths of the earth's surface is water and one fourth is land. It's clear the good Lord intended us to spend triple the amount of time fishing as taking care of the lawn. See you on the water

### Gary Innes (Tesla) - Director
![papile](/images/bod/gary.jpg)

As a dedicated "Surf Rat" for many years I never imagined that there would be anything that would compare to standing on a jetty or rock going toe to toe with a big fish. Then along came kayak fishing and along with it the KFA. In just a short period of time a whole new dimension of fishing was opened up,and I gained a lot of new friends and knowledge along the way. Kayak fishing is like being on my own little rock,only now I am going to the fish instead of them coming to me.

### Gene Kenney (Elkfish) - Past President 
![gene](/images/bod/gene.jpg)

I find peace at or on the water. I have surf fished for many years and got very frustrated with not being able to reach the areas that hold the fish. After much research I decided to purchase a Hobie with mirage drive so that my hands would be free to fish. I found the KFA-NY club soon after. When you get to know me you will find that I put all my efforts into learning all I can about the things that keep my heart pumping. In the past two seasons fishing from my kayak I have caught many new and unusual species of fish. There is nothing like the thrill of hooking into a Manta Ray in a kayak with all your buddies jockeying to move the boats out of the way so you don't lose your fish. The guys in this club are what make this club so special. I hope that I can help make KFA-NY the best that it can be.

###  Tom Conway (nosand) Past Director
![tom](/images/bod/tom.jpg)

I am 55 years old and have lived on Long Island all my life, currently residing in Merrick. I am employed by NYC D.E.P as a stationary engineer electric . I have been married for 27 years and have two children, Molly and Joe. Having always lived near the water I learned to fish at an early age from my Dad. He was a avid freshwater fisherman and that’s how my love of fishing began.(PUSH BUTTON ZEBCO) Over the years my interest changed to saltwater fishing and was a member of a surf fishing club for many years. Due to the lack of locations and low productivity, not to mention high frustration, I turned my attention to kayak fishing. It was love at first launch, not to mention the thrill of the "FIRST BITE”! After researching online I came across the KFA website and reached out to a few members who invited me out and I immediately wanted to be part of the club. . I have been a member of KFA for 4 years now and continue to grow and learn every time I go out on the water . Many different members of the club have graciously shared their knowledge and expertise to enhance my fishing.

###  Bob Bernard (bjb)- Past Director 
![bob](/images/bod/bob.jpg)

Although I've always enjoyed the outdoors, it was limited to hiking, camping and an occasional kayak trip. The subject of kayak fishing came up at work one day in a conversation with Tom (searobin). Even though I was not into fishing, he made it sound interesting. We went to a KFA meeting in Jan ‘09 and that changed me! Listening to these guys talk of their adventures, share their knowledge and welcome us like family was all I needed to hear. We joined on the spot! From the beginning, the willingness of past & current members to patiently help, guide & teach each other has made this club what it is today. They've taught me not only how & where to catch fish, but to safely enjoy and respect the waters we share. Nothing beats the peaceful, tranquility of watching the mist rise off the calm waters of the Nissy at sunrise and the adrenaline rush of hooking into a nice bass at Moriches, than being able to experience it with someone who shares the same passion. This is what makes our club special and why I’m proud to be an active member of it.

### Rich Anemone- Past President 
![rich](/images/bod/richboard.jpg)

During 2008, I was the first president elected by the KFA-NY members. My term followed the legacy of the founding board of directors which was appointed. I began fishing with my dad at a very early age off of piers and rental skiffs in the Point Lookout NY area. At 16 years old I brought my first boat a 15 foot runabout. Throughout the proceeding years I owned various boats. In 2001 with the increase cost of boat ownership and the responsibilities of raising a family it made it impractical for me to continue owning a boat. At that point I began surf fishing and in 2003 I graduated to kayak fishing. As president my goals were to promote safe, effective, and environmentally sound kayak fishing practices while striving to promote conservation, sportsmanship, respect and caring for our marine environment. Through organizations like the KFA-NY we created an information network for all kayak fishermen, from beginner to advanced, exchange ideas and techniques of the sport. I remain committed to passing on these skills and traditions to the next generation of kayak fishers.
