### Welcome to the KFA of New York

Thanks for stopping by and taking a look. Our forum is free to join but the deeper content is in the members only section and if you’d like to view that you can get an application here: (link to form.) Membership is limited so if you want to get into the sport and learn a lot more about it and have fun doing it, don’t wait and risk getting shut out.

We are a Long Island based kayak fishing club but you may find our members (mostly fishing), all over the country for recreation and in tournaments. Primarily we fish in the waters surrounding Long Island, New York City, and sometimes in nearby lakes and reservoirs. Our mission is to promote this growing and exciting spot of kayak fishing, as well conservation of our waters and the fish we love to catch.

The KFA holds 5 indoor meetings between October and March which are open to the general public. At many of the meetings we try to bring in local experts on a diverse range of topics from fresh water strategies, to fish finder operations to conservation and more. Over the fishing season we also have several members-only meetings at outdoor locations which provide excellent fishing opportunities for members that attend after the meeting ends. 

Throughout the pages of our forum we strive to collect and share our vast knowledge and experience of the sport and encourage and facilitate members fishing together. Not only is it safer but its way more fun too!

No matter what your experience level is our club has something for everyone from beginners looking to get their first kayak, cold water safety, marine electronics, and techniques . We are the best resource for kayak fishing bar none.
