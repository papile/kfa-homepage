# About Us
*The Kayak Fishing Association of New York* (**KFA**) is a 503\(c\) non-profit membership organization founded in 2007 with the following core principles:

- Fostering and promoting the sport of kayak fishing
- Ensuring safety with proper gear and knowledge of conditions
- Working for conservation of our environment and marine life

We are a group of kayak fishermen from the NY metro area. Our membership is very diverse from experts to beginners and young to older sharing their knowledge freely in a non competitive friendly organization.

The KFA-NY holds 12 meetings annually. Six are held indoors during the winter months and six are held at various locations during the summer. Our winter/ indoor meetings are free and open to the public; at these meetings we share our knowledge to become better kayak fisherman, have guest presenters, and offer hands-on activities. Our six summer meetings are for members only; at our summer meetings a brief meeting is held to discuss club activities; after this meeting, members may choose to fish surrounding waters.

Through our website forum, the KFA-NY has created an information network for all kayak fishermen, from beginner to advanced, exchange ideas, techniques and skills of the sport. We are committed to passing on these skills and traditions of the sport to the next generation of kayak fishers. This forum is open to the public once you register as a user. There is also a memberâ€™s only area which contains specific information related to kayak fishing as well as club member discounts.
